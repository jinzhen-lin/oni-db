  "Hypothesis: Subjects cloned from Hibiscus will correctly operate a lever apparatus when introduced, demonstrating retention of original donor's conditioned memories.  Donor subject #650, \"Hibiscus\", conditioned to pull a lever to the right for a reward (almonds). Conditioning took place over a period of two weeks.  Hibiscus quickly learned that pulling the lever to the left produced no results, and was reliably demonstrating the desired behavior by the end of the first week.  Training continued for one additional week to strengthen neural pathways and ensure the intended behavioral conditioning was committed to long term and muscle memory.  Cloning subject #762, \"Hibiscus-3\", was introduced to the lever apparatus to ascertain memory retention and recall.  Hibiscus-3 showed no signs of recognition and did not perform the desired behavior. Subject initially failed to interact with the apparatus on any level.  On second introduction, Hibiscus-3 pulled the lever to the left.  Conclusion: Printed subject retains no memory from donor.": "猜想：从芙蓉克隆的实验体可在初次接触时正确操作控制杆装置，展现其保留了原始提供体的条件刺激记忆。  提供体 #650，\"芙蓉\"，在条件刺激下将控制杆拉到右侧以得到奖励（杏仁）。训练时间为期两周。  芙蓉迅速得知将控制杆拉到左侧没有结果，并在第一周结束之前便能够可靠地展现预期的行为。  训练再继续一周以强化神经通路并确保预期的行为训练有助于长期和肌肉记忆。  让克隆的实验体 #762，\"芙蓉-3号\"接触控制杆装置，以便确定记忆保留和唤回情况。  芙蓉-3号没有显示认出该装置的迹象，并且没有执行预期的行为。实验体最初未能与该装置进行任何层级的交互。  在第二次接触时，芙蓉-3号将控制杆拉到了左侧。  结论：打印的实验体没有保留来自提供体的任何记忆。",

  "When we discuss Time as a concrete aspect of the universe, not seconds on a clock or perceptions of the mind, it is important first of all to establish that we are talking about a unique dimension that layers into the three physical dimensions of space: length, width, depth.  We conceive of Real Time as a straight line, one dimensional, uncurved and stretching forward infinitely. This is referred to as the \"Arrow of Time\".  Logically this Arrow can move only forward and can never be reversed, as such a reversal would break the natural laws of the universe. Effect would precede cause and universal entropy would be undone in a blatant violation of the Second Law.  Still, one can't help but wonder; what if the Arrow's trajectory could be curved? What if it could be redirected, guided, or loosed?

That was the main intent behind this project.\"  The Temporal Bow works by rapidly vibrating sections of the 4th dimension to send small quantities of mass forward and backward in time, generating massive amounts of energy with virtually no waste.  \"The fantastic thing about using the 4th dimension as fuel,\" says Stern, \"is that it is really, categorically infinite\".  For those eagerly awaiting the prospect of human time travel, don't get your hopes up just yet.

They weren't inconsiderate of their future selves' busy schedules though; should the guests of honor be unable to attend, they were encouraged to send back a message using the codeword \"Hourglass\" to communicate that, while they certainly wanted to come, they were simply unable.  Sadly no one RSVP'd or arrived to the party, but that did not dishearten Olivia or Jackie.
